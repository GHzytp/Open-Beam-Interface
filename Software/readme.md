See https://github.com/nanographs/Scan-Gen-Glasgow-Testing/tree/main/software/glasgow/applet/video/scan_gen until Glasgow releases out-of-tree applet support and we refactor our software/GUI.

Our current most functional GUI is found at https://github.com/nanographs/Scan-Gen-Glasgow-Testing/tree/main/software/glasgow/applet/video/scan_gen/gui. Future development will be done here.
