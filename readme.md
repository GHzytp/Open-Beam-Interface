## About
The Open Beam Interface project aims to make getting data into and out of scanning and patterning systems substantially more accessible. It is applicable to a variety of scanning and patterning systems but is especially useful for electron and ion microscopes.


### Hardware
Two high-speed digital-to-analog converters to position the beam in X and Y, and a high-speed analog-to-digital converter to acquire the signal from a detector.

Just what you need to control the beam and get an image.

### Gateware
Built on [Glasgow](https://glasgow-embedded.org/), written in [Amaranth](https://amaranth-lang.org).

Glasgow makes getting bytes in and out of the FPGA over USB radically more accessible. We use that to make getting data into and out of your microscope radically more accessible.

### Software
Glasgow handles getting the bytes in and out of your computer. Our software takes those bytes and forms an image, while simultaneously streaming bytes to Glasgow to support raster and vector patterning applications.

## FAQ
- How many bits are the DACs and ADCs
    - 14 bits
- What are the range of dwell times?
    - Minimum dwell time is 125ns, with a minimum temporal resolution of 20.83 ns
    - Hardware supports 50ns dwells when controlling both DACs and the ADC
    - Without sampling the ADC (no video signal), the hardware supports 25ns dwells
    - The limiting factor in most modes is USB bandwidth


## Supported microscopes
We have crafted this board to support as many microscopes as possible. We do not know of a SEM or FIB that specifically does not have these signals ***somewhere*** inside that can be tapped.

Many microscopes have an existing dedicated connector for external scan inputs. Originally, this was generally for external beam control coming from EDS or other X-Ray mapping systems.

For microscopes that do not have a dedicated external scan connector, the X and Y ramps that drive the scan coils exist ***somewhere***. A relay can be installed to flip between internal and external scan. Sometimes, even when microscopes have a dedicated connector, it is better to tap the X and Y signals somewhere else.


### General
- Has a XY scan input that is either:
    - ±1-10V differential
    - ±1-10V single-ended

- Has a video output that is:
    - ±1-10V single-ended

Tapping into the signal path may require fabricating a custom cable.

### Specifically Tested Microscopes
Microscopes the board has been specifically integrated into, this is far from an exhaustive list of microscopes that we could interface with.
#### Full Support
- JEOL 35C
- JEOL 840
- JEOL 63/6400
- JEOL T330
- FEI xT Platform

#### Partial Support
- FEI xP Platform (support for single beam XY input, video output. In progress: support for blanking and internal/external beam control)
    - FIB 200
    - Expedia 830
    - Expedia 1230


## Sponsors
We would like to thank our sponsors' generous sustaining contributions. Without them, we would not be here today.

### Microscope Donations
We are always open to potential microscope donations to use for hardware development, in order to expand the range of microscopes and capabilities we can support. Right now we are especially in search of FIBs, Dual Beams, and TEMs.
